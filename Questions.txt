1. Should I account for negative scale factors?
2. What is the output identifier?
3. The code from Pr. Dejongh seems to anticipate decimal numbers. Should I do that?
4. Are the log files necessary?
5. The previous code made sure to only multiply the last last line by the scale factor. Are you sure that wasn't right?
6. What order do you want multiple files to be printed in?
7. Does the number reset matter?

Next Step
  -> Figure out checked status issue on close
  -> Figure out why it's not running on multiple files
  -> Add clear button
